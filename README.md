## Abstract
Nepal is a profile comparison aligner with optimized scoring function for remote sequence alignment.

## Usage
This directory includes several programs, nepal, pssmcompiler and etc.

### Nepal
Nepal accepts a pairwise PSSM text file, which is generated by pssmcompiler described below, as an input and outputs an alignment in fasta format.

`$ nepal --input [PSSM text file]`

### Pssmcompiler
The python program, pssmcompiler accepts a pairwise sequence fasta file and outputs Nepal readable profile file. You need to set the correct directory of a binary of deltablast, cdd_delta and a pseudo dataset in advance of use of the program.

### Dfnn
Dfnn computes inference of derivative free neural network with CMA-ES. Using the program, the parameters for Nepal was obtained. To compile the program, your computer requires a library "eigen3" installed and C++ compiler.
