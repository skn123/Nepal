# Nepal
**N**eural network **E**nhanced **P**rofile **A**lignment **L**ibrary.
## Abstract
Nepal is a profile comparison aligner with optimized scoring function for remote sequence alignment.
## Usage
This package include two programs such as nepal and pssmcompiler.
### Nepal
Nepal accepts pairwise PSSM text file, which is generated by pssmcompiler described below, as an input and outputs alignment in fasta format.<br><br>
$ nepal --input [PSSM text file]
### pssmcompiler
The python program pssmcompiler accepts a pairwise sequence fasta file and outputs Nepal readable profile file. You need to set the correct directory of a binary of deltablast, cdd_delta and a pseudo dataset in advance of use of it.<br><br>
$ pssmcompiler -i [pairwise sequence fasta file]
