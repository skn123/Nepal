## Summary of files
The program, "dfnn" in a directory "cc" includes derivative free neural network with CMA-ES. Using the program, the parameters for Nepal was obtained. To compile the program, your computer requires a library "eigen3" installed and C++11 compiler.

The file "scop40_training.sp.txt" includes 1721 pairwise sequences and it corresponding PSSM, which was generated by DELTA-BLAST version 2.2.30+ with Conserved Domain Database for the DELTA-BLAST version 3.12.

The file "cc-half-144.txt" includes initial weight and bias values for Nepal. The parameter simply mimics correlation coefficient.

## Compilation and brief usage
1. pushd cc
2. make
3. popd
4. ./cc/dfnn --cpu 12

## Output files
The output file "log.txt" includes hyperparameters for the inference and "w.txt" includes learned weight and bias parameters.
